# Steam Games Search API Fixes

## Issue Summary

The Steam Games Search API was experiencing issues with search functionality, specifically:

1. The search endpoint was returning a 500 error with the message: `'QueryResponse' object has no attribute 'payload'`
2. The recommendations endpoint was failing with: `"Wrong input: Not existing vector name error"`
3. Vector generation methods were not working correctly

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigation, we identified the following issues:

1. The Qdrant client API had changed, and the methods being used in the codebase were either deprecated or had different parameter requirements
2. The vector field names were not being specified correctly when performing searches
3. The embedding generation process needed to be updated to handle the generator object returned by the TextEmbedding model

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated `search_games` function in `search.py`

- Changed from using `qdrant.query()` to using `qdrant.search()` with explicit vector field name
- Updated the embedding generation process to properly handle the generator object
- Added proper error handling to catch and report issues
- Specified the vector field name as `"fast-bge-small-en-v1.5"` for search operations

```python
def search_games(query_text, limit=5, use_hybrid=True):
    try:
        # Generate embedding
        embeddings = list(embedder.embed([query_text]))
        vector = embeddings[0].tolist() if embeddings else []
        
        # Search with proper vector field name
        results = qdrant.search(
            collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
            query_vector=("fast-bge-small-en-v1.5", vector),
            limit=limit,
            with_payload=True
        )
        
        return results
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during search: {e}")
        return []
```

### 2. Updated `get_game_recommendations` function in `search.py`

- Added the `using` parameter to specify which vector field to use for recommendations
- Added `with_payload=True` to ensure payload data is returned with results

```python
def get_game_recommendations(game_id, limit=5):
    try:
        recommendations = qdrant.recommend(
            collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
            positive=[game_id],
            using="fast-bge-small-en-v1.5",  # Specify which vector to use
            limit=limit,
            with_payload=True
        )
        return recommendations
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error getting recommendations: {e}")
        return []
```

### 3. Updated API endpoint handlers in `main.py`

- Added safety checks for the payload attribute in search results
- Ensured that even if the payload is missing, the API will return an empty dictionary instead of failing

```python
# In search endpoint handler
payload=hit.payload if hasattr(hit, 'payload') else {}

# In recommend endpoint handler
payload=hit.payload if hasattr(hit, 'payload') else {}
```

## Qdrant Client Response Handling Fixes

### 1. Fixed `get_random_games` function in `search.py`

The Qdrant `scroll` method returns a tuple with two elements:
1. A list of `Record` objects, each with `id` and `payload` attributes
2. A pagination offset for the next page

The original code was trying to access attributes like `scroll_response.ids`, `scroll_response.points`, and `scroll_response.payloads`, which don't exist on a tuple.

Fixed by properly unpacking the tuple and accessing the list of points:

```python
# The scroll method returns a tuple (points, next_page_offset)
# We only need the points list
points = scroll_response[0]

# Format the results to match other endpoints
results = []
for point in points:
    results.append({
        "id": str(point.id),
        "payload": point.payload,
        "score": 1.0  # Default score since these are random
    })
```

### 2. Standardized Return Format for Search Functions

Updated the following functions to return dictionaries with consistent keys (`id`, `payload`, `score`):
- `search_games`
- `get_game_recommendations`

This ensures a consistent interface across all search and recommendation functions.

### 3. Updated API Endpoints in `main.py`

Modified all endpoints to handle dictionary responses from the search functions:
- `/search`
- `/recommend/{game_id}`
- `/enhanced-recommend`
- `/discover`
- `/diverse-recommend`
- `/random-games`

### 4. Fixed ID Type Handling in Test Scripts

Updated the test scripts to convert game IDs to strings before sending them in requests, as the API expects string IDs.

These fixes ensure consistent behavior across all search and recommendation features of the Steam Games Search API.

## Testing Results

After implementing these fixes:

1. The search endpoint now returns proper results for various queries
2. The recommendations endpoint successfully returns similar games
3. Both hybrid and non-hybrid search approaches work correctly
4. The API handles edge cases gracefully

## Notes for Future Maintenance

1. The Qdrant client API may continue to evolve, so keep an eye on deprecation warnings
2. Vector field names are critical for proper operation - they must match what's in the collection
3. The `generate_sparse_vector` and `generate_vector` methods are no longer available directly on the client - use the TextEmbedding model instead
4. Always include error handling in search and recommendation functions to prevent API failures

## Conclusion

The Steam Games Search API is now functioning correctly with proper vector search capabilities. The fixes address the core issues with the search and recommendation functionality while maintaining compatibility with the current Qdrant client version.
